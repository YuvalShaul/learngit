# Remote Branches



## Create Repositories

- Go to your github account anc create a public repository.  
(I have created one called **demo**)  
This is just a training session, so you will remove this repository when you're done.
- Localy, create a working directory, and 2 directories under that:
```
mkdir workgit
cd workgit/
mkdir a
mkdir b
```
- Clone your **demo** repository into **a** and **b**:
```
cd a/
clone <your repository url>
cd ../b/
clone <your repository url>
```
