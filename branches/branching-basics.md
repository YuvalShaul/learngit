# Branching Basics

## Creating a repository

- Create a new directory called demo (could be anywhere you are comfortable working at), **cd** into this directory and initiage a git repository:
```
mkdir demo
cd demo
git init
```
- Check the status of this repository:
```
git status
```
- Verify that the master branch there does not really ewxist:
```
git branch
```
(so no branch currently exists)
